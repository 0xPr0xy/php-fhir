# php-fhir
Tools for creating FHIR classes in PHP for use by a client.

This library is a work in progress.

## Basic Usage

After installation via Composer, you will need to procure XSD's for your desired FHIR spec version.  See
[http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html](http://hl7.org/fhir/directory.html) for a version list.

Once this directory is downloaded and un-zipped, a simple script to build classes from the above XSD's is as follows:

```php
<?php
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$xsdPath = 'path to wherever you un-zipped the xsd files';

$generator = new \PHPFHIR\Generator($xsdPath);

$generator->generate();
```

There is a 2nd (optional) argument that will allow you to specify the root directory and namespace
class files will be generated under.  The default value is 'PHPFHIRGenerated'.

There is a 3rd (optional) argument that will allow you to specify the parent directory all
class files will be generated under.  By default this value is null, and the files
will be placed under the included "output" directory.

## Autoloading

As the final step class generation, an autoloader class will be created and placed under the root
of the above specified root NS directory.  It will be called `PHPFHIRAutoloader`, and have the same
root namespace as the rest of the generated classes.  To utilize, simply require this file and execute

```php
{BaseNamespace}\PHPFHIRAutoloader::register();
```

You may then use all of the classes generated by this library without having to manually include them.

## Known Things

- Implementation of value-restricted properties and objects
- Optional value validity checking

## Testing

Currently this library is being tested against v0.0.82 and v1.0.2.  For a version history of FHIR, see here:

## Suggestions and help
